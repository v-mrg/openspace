# OpenSpace Simulation
This is a simulation setup for OpenSpace, an architectural roadmap for a more open and heterogeneous satellite Internet paradigm.
In the branch simple-sim, we simulate the total coverage per number of satellites, and the minimum latency via n-hop ISLs per a randomized number of satellites.
We run a simplified simulation, fixing the user and groundstation coordinates and randomly distributing satellites orbital paths. 
We then compute the shortest path between the satellite that picks up the userâ€™s signal, and the satellite that will relay that signal to the ground station, and use this path length to estimate latency. 
To get a realistic coverage estimate, we assume that if there is any overlap between a pair of satellite ranges, their effective coverage will be reduced to that of a single satellite.
That is, we take the worst case where two satellites have completely overlapping ground coverage.
